subtitle: A fancy robotics library for safety critical systems
---

Fancy Safe Bot is a modern robotics library intended to be used in [**safety critical**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety-critical_system) systems. Dive deeper into the [**documentation**](https://docs.fancysafebot.com) to learn more about how you can use it to control robots designed with safety in mind.

The library is in [**active development**](https://github.com/fancysafebot/fancysafebotlib) and we'd love to hear from you about how to make the library better and what features you'd like to see. Please have a look at the [**developer's guide**](https://github.com/fancysafebot/fancysafebotlib/docs/topics/DevelopersGuide.md) if you'd like to contribute.

## What is special about Fancy Safe Bot

Fancy Safe Bot strives to make it possible to integrate robotic control software into safety critical systems with the following library features:

- Follows strict coding standards ([MISRA](https://misra.org.uk/))
- Documentation of the library requirements and software design
- Unit testing, code coverage, static analysis, and profiling
- Sample applications with target embedded hardware

Software designed for safety-critical systems needs to be certified for its intended use, whether in medical robotics, self-driving cars, space robotics, aviation, or other applications where safety is paramount. Large open-source software projects (including ROS) are difficult to get certified in these applications where the entire design, verification, and validation process must adhere to strict international standards (for example, [IEC 80601-2-77:2019](https://www.iso.org/standard/68473.html)).

Fancy Safe Bot addresses these challenges with an open-source robotics library that can be integrated into a certifiable software development process.
